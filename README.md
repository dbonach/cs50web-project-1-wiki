# Wikipedia-like encyclopedia

![project1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62313672/121787408-46e9db80-cb9c-11eb-9033-e1f390e4b603.gif)

This is my implementation of project 1 from [CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/), 2020 version.

The project consists of a web application similar to wikipedia using Django framework, where we can:
- Add entries
- Edit any pages
- Go to a random page
- Search for entries even when the entry only has the query search as a substring, for example, searching for “ytho”, then Python should appear in the search results.

You can see all the requirements on [this page](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/1/wiki/).

### Responsiveness

I also made the page responsible for smaller screens and used javascript to manipulate the DOM to show and hide the bar menu.
